# ToDoList(Trello Board Ui)

Trello is a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application. 
This project is an attempt to develop a similar user interface, add functionalities similar to the one used on Trello to create a scrum board, to-do list, or in 
project development.

## Live Demo

## Key Learning

The Ui is inspired by the boards that are available on trello.
In this project, I have used the drag-and-drop api which is used to 
move tasks from one columns to another. 
It uses the local storage to store and update the content for you. 

## Run Locally

```bash
Clone the repository.
```
    Run the index.html file.
``` 
Checkout the main.js file for all the functions.
```
